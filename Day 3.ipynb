    "In Part 1, we find the coordinates within each fabric swatch that overlap with at least one other and return those and produce a count.  In Part 2, we find the single fabric ID that has no coordinates in common with any others.\n",
    "\n",
    "A somewhat expected interpretation on this problem is to represent it as a grid and then ostensibly you can mark and sweep the grid as you work through each fabric.  Likely you'd need to pre-process the list of fabrics and the coordinates to know how big of a grid to build (which could be quite big) though since everythign is coordinate based you'd have O(1) lookups into any position once you'd initialized the grid.  I went a different way on this, though, and viewed the problem through the lens of set membership.  Basically, each fabric I viewed as comprising a set of coordinates.  I then used set membership functions to compare that set to the sets for other fabrics to ultimately produce a final overlapping set. I don't know that performance or space complexity is much different since in both cases you'd need a structure that holds or represents the coordinates.  Since I hold both the intersected coordinates (the overlaps) and all of them (the union), I'm not really saving space though since every lookup I perform is through the set, I can get O(1) on testing memberships.  A possible optimization is to consider a way to assess the overlap of two fabrics without the need to hold the full set of coordinates thereafter, such as a bounding box overlap algorithm.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 2, the requirement was to find the non-overlapping fabric.  My first function to find the overlapping coords didn't have an easy modification within its logic to add that in.  However, I was able to build on top of it by first finding the overlapping coords, then retesting each fabric to find the fabric whose coordinates were disjoint with the overlapping set, the idea being that the target fabric contributed nothing to the overlapping set so the intersection would be empty.
